            <p>Hi, I'm Hunter. I'm 22 years old and live in Idaho Falls. I'm technically in my third year of college; transferring from CEI to BYU-I. I'm currently on my off track, hence the online class.</p>
            <p>I love guns, hunting, energy drinks, and videogames, among other things. I'm unmarried and currently working at a pizza shop (Lucy's if you're familiar) as a delivery driver/dishwasher.</p>
