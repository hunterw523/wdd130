      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Arguably the most important part of a firearm is the ammunition. Without it, you got a heavy paperweight. This site will serve the function of allowing individuals to order custom ammunition to their exact specifications. The site will hopefully help spread HDM's reach to across the nation.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Any individuals who desire to actually use their guns. At the moment, the company has put a specific emphasis towards competitive shooters, whether for precision or bulk ammo orders.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        At High Desert Munitions, it is our goal to provide the highest quality ammunition we can. Whether you're looking for extreme accuracy, training at high volumes, or just wanna stay stocked up, we're the company to go to.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know that shooting sports can get expensive, quick. High Desert Munitions has taken the pledge to keep prices as low as we reasonably can.

      <h3>Services</h3>
      <p>
        Precision Package: To unlock the potential. 
        (This info could be contained in a dropdown box or something) Every rifle is unique. One load that shoots well in one rifle may not shoot well in another. We want to help unlock the potential your rife holds. The Precision Package will contain a wide variety of load variation to help narrow down what is most accurate in your particular rifle. (Then I'd eventually add much more detail about certain options.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Bulk Package: To improve skills.
        Whether you're a competitive shooter, or simply want to be prepared for the worst, we provide bulk purchases of ammunition. Bulk packages can be ordered in 1000 or 5000 round boxes. For 9mm and 223 only, we do offer a special 10,000 round option. More unique calibers could be denied due to component availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exotic Package: To be different.
        Sometimes, you may want something more unique and specific. We offer a wide array of customization, from bullet type, to specific gunpowders. With the help of our technicions, we can work with you to create the custom ammo of your dreams. 
        Note: Safety is our number one priority. We hold the right to deny any load we deem unsafe.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        What is your pricing? We try to keep our pricing as fair as possible. For the ammo itself, we charge for the exact price of the components + 15% labor charge. This does not include the price of shipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        What calibers do you load for? We will load any caliber if a reloading die and loading data exists for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you load any ammo for shotguns? We are in the process of aquiring the neccessary tools to do so. Eventually, we will offer shotgun loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why can't I buy 22 lr? 22 lr is a rimfire cartridge. Very specialized and expensive tools are required to load rimfire cartridges. We are not at a point as a company to afford these machines.
